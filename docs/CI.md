# CI

This document describes the CI/CD pipeline for the project. This document is for those developing on the project to understand everything that is running when they make a change to the code. If you are interested in modifying the CI/CD pipeline, see [README](.github/workflows/README.md) in the workflows directory.

## PRs

CI for a PR will trigger whenever a PR is opened, reopened, or pushed. The jobs ran on a PR are meant to be lightweight enough that we can repeatedly run them (each push) but cover enough of the code that we don't have to create a followup PR to fix things that we've missed. The binary for the PR will not be saved from the CI build. The jobs ran on a PR are:

- 'vet' - Check the code changes and make sure they adhere to the standard Golang style guide
- 'test' - Run the unit tests on the code changes
- 'build' - Build a binary containing the code changes

## Merging to main

Merging to main runs many of the same tests as a PR to verify that merging the code didn't introduce any new issues. Merging will also run integration tests to verify that the code works with the rest of the system as these tests require more setup and take longer to run. The binary from the build can be found in the artifacts list on the action's page.

TODO: code coverage
TODO: If you merge a change into main and an issue is found, you will be notified on slack that you have broken main and need to fix it.

## Releases

A release is triggered when a pre-release is created in the github repo. This will run EVERYTHING from scratch. Starting from zero may take more time but this ensures that nothing slips by us before sending out the release. This includes any static code analysis, unit tests, integration tests, and building the binaries. If everything passes, The binary will be uploaded to the release page. This process is documented in [Creating a release](docs/creating-a-release.md).
